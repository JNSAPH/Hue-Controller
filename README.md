## Why should i use this?
Signify already offers a way to control lamps via the Philips Hue Bridge. The problem with this solution, however, is that an entertainment area has to be created in the app. However, the entertainment area can only be equipped with original Philips Hue lamps, LED strips, etc.. This trys to be an alternative to get the same functionality for non-Phillips Branded Lamps.
